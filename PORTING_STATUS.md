## 🔄 Partially Implemented

### Audio System
- ⚠️ Mock implementations only - needs real audio library integration
- ⚠️ Voice channel connection not implemented
- ⚠️ Actual audio playback not implemented

### TTS (Text-to-Speech)
- ⚠️ DecTalk wrapper exists in Java but not ported
- ⚠️ Speak command placeholder only

### URL Replacement
- ⚠️ Webhook integration not implemented
- ⚠️ Currently sends follow-up messages instead of replacing

### Permission Checks
- ⚠️ Permission checking framework exists but not enforced
- ⚠️ Commands lack proper permission validation

## ❌ Not Yet Implemented

### External Integrations
- ❌ OpenAI API integration (ChatTest command)
- ❌ LavaPlayer equivalent for Dart
- ❌ DecTalk DLL integration

### Advanced Features
- ❌ Webhook management for seamless URL replacement
- ❌ Proper Discord presence/status updates
- ❌ File-based persistence for stats and history

### Java-Specific Features
- ❌ DecTalk C wrapper integration
- ❌ Complex audio source management
- ❌ Advanced permission checking

## 📋 Next Steps

1. **Audio Implementation**: Integrate a Dart audio library equivalent to LavaPlayer
2. **Voice Channel Support**: Implement voice channel connection and audio streaming
3. **TTS Integration**: Port or rewrite DecTalk functionality
4. **Webhook System**: Implement webhook creation and management for URL replacement
5. **Persistence**: Add file-based storage for emote stats and nickname history
6. **Permission System**: Implement proper Discord permission checking
7. **Error Handling**: Add comprehensive error handling and logging

## 🔧 Technical Notes

- Using nyxx_commands framework for Discord interaction
- Mixin-based architecture for modular functionality
- YAML configuration for bot settings
- Timer-based scheduling for recurring tasks
- RegExp-based URL and emote detection

## 🎯 Core Functionality Status

The bot now has all the basic command structures and placeholder functionality from the Java version. The major remaining work is integrating real audio playback, implementing TTS, and adding external service integrations.
